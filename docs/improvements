 Backend-Only Refactoring Recommendations

  Immediate (High Impact)

  1. Split ArticleService into focused services
    - Extract DuplicationService utility (shared duplicate checking logic)
    - Create ArticleFetchService (NewsAPI operations only)
    - Create ArticleProcessingService (LLM processing only)
    - Create ArticleStorageService (database operations only)
  2. Add structured error handling across all services
    - Implement problem+json format (type, title, status, detail, instance)
    - Replace console.error() with structured error responses
    - Add error context and request correlation IDs
  3. Create database connection management
    - Add connection pooling for SQLite
    - Implement transaction management for multi-step operations
    - Add proper connection cleanup and timeout handling

  Short-term (Medium Impact)

  4. Implement dependency injection container
    - Create ServiceContainer interface
    - Remove hard-coded service instantiation from constructors
    - Enable better testing and service lifecycle management
  5. Add health monitoring services
    - Create HealthService for /healthz and /readyz endpoints
    - Implement database connectivity checks
    - Add external service status monitoring (LLM, RSS feeds)
  6. Standardize logging across services
    - Add structured JSON logging with consistent format
    - Include request IDs, latency, and service context
    - Replace console.log with proper logging service

  Long-term (Architecture Improvements)

  7. Split database services by domain
    - Create ArticleRepository (articles table operations)
    - Create RSSFeedRepository (RSS feeds table operations)
    - Extract shared DatabaseConnection base class
  8. Improve configuration management
    - Move config validation from module load to service initialization
    - Add environment-specific configuration loading
    - Implement graceful degradation for missing services
  9. Add service resilience patterns
    - Implement circuit breaker for external API calls
    - Add retry logic with exponential backoff
    - Create timeout and rate limiting for RSS polling
  10. Create proper service lifecycle management
    - Add graceful shutdown handling (SIGTERM/SIGINT)
    - Implement proper resource cleanup
    - Add service startup/shutdown orchestration

  All recommendations focus purely on backend services, database management, API resilience, and service
  architecture improvements. No frontend or UI components involved.
