Yes! Here are several ways to run tests in Docker:       

  From Docker Compose

  # Run tests in the API service
  docker-compose exec api pnpm -r test

  # Or using the npm script I added
  npm run docker:test

  From Docker Exec

  # Get the container ID/name first
  docker ps

  # Then exec into it
  docker exec -it globalnews_api pnpm -r test

  # Or one-liner
  docker exec globalnews_api pnpm -r test

  Run Tests in Fresh Container

  # Run tests in a new container (ensures clean state)     
  docker-compose run --rm api pnpm -r test

  # With specific test file
  docker-compose run --rm api pnpm test
  --workspace=@mtrx/api src/tests/feeds.test.ts

  Interactive Shell for Testing

  # Get a shell inside the container
  docker-compose exec api sh

  # Then run any commands
  pnpm -r test
  pnpm lint
  pnpm typecheck

  Test-Specific Docker Commands

  You could also add more specific test commands to        
  package.json:

  "docker:test:api": "docker-compose run --rm api pnpm     
  test --workspace=@mtrx/api",
  "docker:test:watch": "docker-compose run --rm api        
  pnpm test --watch",
  "docker:lint": "docker-compose run --rm api pnpm
  lint",
  "docker:typecheck": "docker-compose run --rm api pnpm    
   typecheck"
============================================
● Yes, I can see Docker container output! Here's how to
   continue development with Docker + VS Code + Claude:

  🐳 Docker + VS Code + Claude Development Workflow

  1. Start Development Environment

  # Start containers with live logs
  npm run docker:dev

  # Or detached mode
  npm run docker:up

  2. VS Code Setup

  Install these extensions:
  - Docker - Container management in VS Code
  - Dev Containers - Develop inside containers
  - Remote - Containers - Edit files in containers

  3. Claude Integration

  I can see and interact with:
  - ✅ Container logs via docker-compose logs or npm       
  run docker:logs
  - ✅ File changes when you mount volumes
  - ✅ Test results from docker exec commands
  - ✅ Build output from Docker builds
  - ✅ Database state via container exec

  4. Development Commands I Can Run

  # View live logs
  npm run docker:logs

  # Run tests and see results
  docker-compose exec api pnpm -r test

  # Check container status
  docker-compose ps

  # Execute any command in container
  docker-compose exec api pnpm lint
  docker-compose exec api pnpm typecheck

  # Database operations
  docker-compose exec api npm run db:init

  5. Hot Reload Setup

  Your docker-compose.override.yml already mounts
  source code:
  volumes:
    - ./apps/api/src:/app/src:ro  # I can see file
  changes

  6. Typical Development Flow

  1. You edit files in VS Code
  2. Hot reload updates container automatically
  3. I run commands like:
  docker-compose exec api pnpm test
  4. I see output and help debug issues
  5. Repeat the cycle

  7. What I Can Help With

  - 🔍 Debug container issues from logs
  - 🧪 Run tests and interpret results
  - 📊 Monitor health via health endpoints
  - 🛠️ Fix code issues based on container output
  - 📋 Database management via Docker exec

  8. VS Code Dev Container Alternative

  You can also develop inside the container:
  # Open project in container
  code .
  # Use Command Palette: "Remote-Containers: Reopen in     
  Container"

  The key advantage: I can see everything happening in     
  the containers, so development continues seamlessly      
  with better isolation and consistent environment
  across platforms!
